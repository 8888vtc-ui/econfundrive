          <h2>Choosing your main travel times</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Try to avoid peak weekend times for airport transfers and check-ins.</li>
            <li>Plan extra time before important appointments or events.</li>
            <li>Consider early morning or later evening departures when possible.</li>

          <h2>Parking in busy areas</h2>
          <p>Some coastal towns and resorts have limited parking in high season. If you rent a car, check your accommodation’s parking options and nearby public car parks.</p>

          <h2>When a private driver can be helpful</h2>
          <p>For key transfers (airport, important dinners, events, hilltop villages), using a private driver may be simpler than driving yourself. You avoid searching for parking and can focus on your stay.</p>
          <p>To organise your main transfers, you can describe your dates and key journeys through the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a>.</p>
