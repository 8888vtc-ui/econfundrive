          <p>The French Riviera is not only about the sea. Several hilltop villages offer great views and quiet streets, just a short drive from the coast.</p>

          <h2>Why a private driver can help</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You do not have to focus on narrow or winding roads.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the time spent in each village.</li>
            <li>You avoid searching for parking spaces several times in the same day.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you would like to organise this kind of day, you can describe your idea in the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a> and mention the villages or type of scenery you would like to see.</p>
