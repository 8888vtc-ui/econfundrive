        </div>
        <p>To request a transfer, please fill in the French booking form (easy to understand) with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pick‑up address (or airport / train station) and drop‑off address.</li>
          <li>Date, time and flight or train number if applicable.</li>
          <li>Number of passengers and pieces of luggage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In most cases, transfers must be booked at least 4 hours before pick‑up time. For very last‑minute requests, you can call the driver or use the WhatsApp button on the website to check if a slot is still available (no guarantee).</p>
