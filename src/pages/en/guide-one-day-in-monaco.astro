          <h2>How to get to Monaco</h2>
          <p>You can reach Monaco by train, bus or car from many towns on the French Riviera. A private driver is useful if you want to combine Monaco with photo stops on the scenic roads or a visit to a hilltop village.</p>
          <p>If you prefer a flexible schedule, you can mention your plan in the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a> and ask for a quote including Monaco and a few stops along the way.</p>
