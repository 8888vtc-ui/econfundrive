          <h2>When does a long-distance transfer make sense?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>When you travel with several people and a lot of luggage.</li>
            <li>When your destination is not well connected by train or plane.</li>
            <li>When you prefer a direct journey from door to door.</li>

          <h2>Making the journey more comfortable</h2>
          <p>For long-distance trips, it is usually better to plan a few short breaks. Let your driver know if you prefer to stop in a particular town or service area.</p>
          <p>To describe your project, you can use the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a> and mention that you are interested in a long-distance transfer from the French Riviera.</p>
