          <h2>Day 1: old town and seaside</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Walk through the old town and its narrow streets.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the local market and cafés.</li>
            <li>Finish the day with a walk along the Promenade des Anglais.</li>

          <h2>Day 2: museums and viewpoints</h2>
          <p>On your second day, you may want to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>visit one or two museums depending on your interests;</li>
            <li>take a walk on one of the hills around Nice for a sea view;</li>
            <li>go out for dinner in the old town or by the sea.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can use public transport, taxis or a private driver for the trips that are further away from the centre.</p>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Day 3: easy day trips</h2>
          <p>If you stay three days, consider a simple day trip to a nearby town or village. For example: Antibes, a hilltop village, or a short visit to Monaco.</p>
          <p>A private driver can be useful if you prefer a flexible schedule and several stops in the same day. You can mention this in the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a>.</p>
