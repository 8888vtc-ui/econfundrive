          <p>During the Cannes Film Festival, MIPIM, Cannes Lions and other major events, the town becomes very busy. Here are a few simple ideas to keep your transport under control.</p>
        </div>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Plan your airport transfers</h2>
          <p>Most international guests arrive through Nice Airport. If you are travelling in a group or have a tight schedule, plan your transfers in advance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>share your flight number and hotel address with your driver;</li>
            <li>allow extra time for traffic between the airport and Cannes;</li>
            <li>consider grouped transfers for teams or guests.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Moving between hotel, Palais and evening venues</h2>
          <p>During festivals, a typical day often includes meetings, screenings, dinners and parties. Using a private driver can help you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>avoid waiting for taxis at busy times;</li>
            <li>secure pick-up and drop-off times in advance;</li>
            <li>offer a reliable service to your guests or clients.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Coordinating your schedule</h2>
          <p>When you send your request, try to include your main time slots: arrival and departure, important meetings, evening events. This makes it easier to suggest a realistic transport plan.</p>
          <p>For an overview of the services available, you can read the page <a href="/en/cannes-private-driver">Cannes private driver</a> or describe your needs through the <a href="/reservation">booking form</a>.</p>
