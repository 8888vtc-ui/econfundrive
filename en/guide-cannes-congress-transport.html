          <p>During major congresses, such as MIPIM or Cannes Lions, it is important to treat transport as part of your overall organisation, not as an afterthought.</p>

          <h2>Airport transfers for speakers and teams</h2>
          <p>For key speakers or teams arriving at Nice Airport, you can plan individual or shared transfers. Share flight details, hotel addresses and your internal contact person with your driver.</p>

          <h2>Daily shuttles between hotel and Palais</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Define your busiest time slots in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li>Decide whether you need a car on stand-by or only punctual transfers.</li>
            <li>Anticipate late returns after dinners or networking events.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Sharing a clear brief</h2>
          <p>When requesting a quote, a short but precise brief (dates, number of people, type of use) helps build a realistic offer. You can send these details using the <a href="/reservation.html">booking form</a>.</p>
