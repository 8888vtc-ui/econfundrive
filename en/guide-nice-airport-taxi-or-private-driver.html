          <h2>How a taxi works at Nice Airport</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Official taxi ranks are located just outside the terminals.</li>
            <li>Fares are metered and can vary depending on traffic and route.</li>
            <li>There may be a queue at peak arrival times.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>How a private driver service works</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Your trip is requested in advance, usually by message or booking form.</li>
            <li>You receive an estimated price before confirming.</li>
            <li>The driver waits for you at the agreed meeting point with a name sign.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Which option should you choose?</h2>
          <p>If you are travelling light and speak some French, a taxi can be a simple last-minute option. If you prefer a more personalised service, with prices shared in advance and direct contact with the driver, a private driver is often more comfortable.</p>
          <p>To learn more about private transfers, you can check the page <a href="/en/nice-airport-to-cannes-transfer.html">Nice Airport &rarr; Cannes transfer</a> or send a request through the French <a href="/reservation.html">booking form</a>.</p>
