          <p>With a bit of planning, the French Riviera can be very pleasant with children. The idea is to keep the day simple and avoid too many changes of place.</p>

          <h2>Combining beach and easy walk</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose a beach that is easy to access with children and bags.</li>
            <li>Keep some time for a short walk in a nearby town or village.</li>
            <li>Plan simple meals and enough breaks during the day.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>Thinking in terms of rhythm, not in terms of places</h2>
          <p>Instead of trying to see as many places as possible, it is often better to think about the rhythm of the day: when the children are usually full of energy, when they need rest, and how long they can stay in the car.</p>

        <section class="section" style="padding-top:1.5rem">
          <h2>How a private driver can help families</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Child seats can usually be arranged on request.</li>
            <li>You do not have to carry luggage or pushchairs on public transport.</li>
            <li>You can shorten or extend the day depending on how everyone feels.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you send your request through the <a href="/reservation.html">booking form</a>, you can mention the age of the children and your preferred type of day.</p>
